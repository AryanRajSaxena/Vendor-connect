                        ↓ (+25% platform markup)
CUSTOMER Pays:      ₹1,250 (final price)
                        ↓
Distribution:
├─ Vendor:          ₹937.50 (75%)
├─ Seller:          ₹125.00 (10%)

Every page checks user role. Only matching users can access:

```
Customer pages: user.role === 'customer'
Vendor pages:   user.role === 'vendor'
Seller pages:   user.role === 'seller'
Admin pages:    user.role === 'admin'
```

Mismatched role → redirects to `/` (home)
